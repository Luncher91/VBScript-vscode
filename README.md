# VBScript symbols extension

This extension provides symbols for VBScript.

Pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>O</kbd> lists all symbols of the current file.

You also can display symbols by using extensions like "Code Outline" by Patryk Zawadzki.

## Supported Symbols

- __Class__
- __Function__
- __Sub__
- __Property__
- __Field__
- global and class wide __Const__
- global __Dim__

## Known issues

- A multiline (seperated by an underscore _ ) definition will not be recognized.


## Fixed issues

- You can now indent with tabulation and the extension will still work.
